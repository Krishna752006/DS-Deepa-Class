Binary Search (Only in a sorted Array)

l = 0, r = size - 1, m = l+((r-l)/2) (To Avoid Boundary cases as if r and l are big and if we do r + l, it will go out of range of storage in int)

[1,3,5,7,9,18] -> say target is 3

l = 0, r = 5, m = 3 => Arr[m]=7

At Arr[m] arready checked, so r = m - 1 => 
while(l<=r)
{
if(Arr[m]<t) 
{l = m + 1 }
else
{r = m - 1 }
}

now m becomes 3 and target is found

check for [1,3,5,9,18]
