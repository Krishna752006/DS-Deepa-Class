main() -> only called by compiler

call stack

Method invoke itself -> Recursion

continuously calling will lead to stack overflow Exception

time complexity as compared to a loop?

base condition --> Condition to stop creating infinite stacks
-->placed before recursion

when recursion is used ? Ans: when big problem mechanism = small problem mechanism

E.g.: Opening 7 Directories, same action i.e. clicking 7 times to get to the end point ( last file ) i.e. base condition

Think of function(a, b) not as computer one but as mathematical one i.e. f(x) 
like f(5) = 5 + f(4) ...

Identify whether a problem can be solved through recursion
Arithmetic Progression -> can't be solved through regression

recursion on sum of natural numbers, factorial, a to the power of b
