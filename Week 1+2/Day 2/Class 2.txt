Array is a non primitive data structure.

Is it defined by user? library? ..

Similar to Java

add an element in 6th position what happens?

when you insert elements are shifted to right and if added in start, the last element will be deleted

Array -> fixed length and the elements are accessed via index

insert(data element, index)

say [10,11,12,13,14] and insert(100,3) then result[10,11,12,100,13] we are not replacing but inserting and shifting the remaining places.

insert() != a[i+1]=a[i] -> wrong as it gives wrong shifting results
insert() = a[i] = a[i-1] -> shifting from the back to yield better and desired results

delete() -> shift to the left side

delete by index, element, min element, max element

mountain array(with one peak) [12,13,24,15,6]
not a mountain array [12,13,24,15,16]

try with 2 peaks....
