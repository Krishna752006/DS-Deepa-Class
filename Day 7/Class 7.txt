Recap of previous sems

[[0,1,2,3],[4,5,6,7]] say address of 1 = 2000 then what is address of 6(2D Array)?

row major or column major, by default, it is row major i.e. after 3,4,5 will come and so on...

say in column major, 0,4,1,5...

integer pointer ...

a[row][column]

for slicing using pointer -> we nned to know row major or column major...

calloc, malloc -> dynamically allocating memory

static vs dynamic memory?
when do they die? when are they created?

stack created -> static memory
outside stack -> dynamic memory (Objects) -> heap

stack + heap -> on RAM

main()
{
int a[5]; -> in stack or heap?
int a[] = new int[10]; -> given 20 bytes at runtime(dynamic)
delete a; -> to destroy memory on heap
}

normal array vs dynamic array ?

class = state + behaviour

methods in c++ can be outside class
main method can be without class in c++

package level in c++?

class ending };

Pen p(12,99.9,"Camlin"); -> On stack
Pen p1 = new Pen(13,43.34,"Gold"); -> Error
Pen *p1 = new Pen(13,43.34,"Gold") -> Created on Heap, preferred by c++ as in stack there is limited space on compared to heap
p1->display(); //Heap
p.display(); //Stack
delete p; //error as it is static
delete p1;

`Pen()
{
cout << "Destructor called";
}

sum of all the variables defined in the stack

300 lines , os help, harddrive, stack, cashing ...

cashe -> stored data that is used frequently

2 ways of creating objects in c++ -> static(less time, slow, less space) and dynamic
