main() -> only called by compiler

call stack

Method invoke itself -> Recurrsion

continuously calling will lead to stack overflow Exception

time complexity as compared to a loop?

base condition --> Codition to stop creating infinite stacks
-->placed before recursion

when resurrsion is used ? ans: when big problem mechanism = small problem mechanism

Eg: Opening 7 Directiories, same action i.e. clicking 7 times to get to the end point ( last file ) i.e. base condition

Think of function(a,b) not as computer one but as mathematical one i.e. f(x) 
like f(5) = 5 + f(4) ...

Identify whether a problem can be solved through recurrsion
Arithematic Progression -> can't be solved through regression

recurrsion on sum of natural numbers, factorial, a to the power of b
