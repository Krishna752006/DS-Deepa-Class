Templates of C++ building and using it

Template is a generic blueprint that works with any type of data unlike class that works with specific data type e.g.: int stack, string stack, etc...

This is used when we are using multiple data types in code.
This is like Generics in Collections in java.

#include <stack> -> library or Template in C++

Stack -> used in sequences, min, max, range time series

monotonic stack

monotonic increasing stack -> highest is at top
monotonic decreasing stack -> lowest is at top

Next Greater element using stack
No. of days for warmer Temp
Previous Greater Element
Next Smaller Element
